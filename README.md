# Automated COVID-19 Diagnostics from Chest Radiographic Images
### Team DeepBreath

## Introduction
This GitHub repository hosts a cutting-edge project in biomedical engineering, aimed at addressing critical issues in COVID-19 diagnostics. We present an Artificial Intelligence-powered Chest Lesion Detector, using deep learning techniques for diagnosing COVID-19 from chest radiographic images.

## Local Issues in Biomedical Engineering in Ghana
The project tackles several gaps identified in the field of biomedical engineering:                        
**1. Low specificity among radiologists**                         
**2. The paucity of radiologists in Ghana**                     
**3. Long duration for diagnostics**                      
**4. High cost per utility for diagnostics**           

## Project Gap
To bridge these gaps, our project focuses on the following aspects:

* Implementing image preprocessing techniques for precise imaging, optimized cost, and reduced radiation dose.
* Developing an Artificial Intelligence model of high accuracy for automated diagnostics of COVID-19 from Chest CT Scans.
* Creating an automated system for fast and accurate COVID-19 diagnostics.
